# FTMV LMS

## Description
The acronym here reads learnER management system as opposed to learnING management system. 
This plugin faciliates the creation of programmes, facilitators and students associated with said programmes and courses which are instances of programmes that run at designated intervals. The plugin also enables users to restrict pages or posts and assign them to programmes thus creating the content which students then have access to while not being able to view content that they are not assigned to.

Initially created as a solution for a client's needs. I started by creating code in a child theme's function file. While this served the purpose I knew that this was not best practice and wanting to expand my WordPress knowledge as well as PHP knowledge I sought to turn the code into a plugin. 

I followed along with [Ratko Solaja's](https://www.toptal.com/wordpress/ultimate-guide-building-wordpress-plugin) amazing walkthrought on building a plugin. Using his boilerplate code I built my plugin.

Created for a client's specific needs but trying to generalise in the interests of possibly creating a useful plugin.

**FTMV LMS** will give users the ability to create top level courses and then instances of when those courses run - eg. History 101 (top level) and then it running from say 1 March - 30 June (An instance). 

From the creation of this top level course a user type of facilitator and student associated with the course are created. Admin still has to create a facilitator associated with a specific course. The facilitator has the capabilities and permissions to create instances of the top level course and create new students for an instance of the course.

Students of the associated course are created with the capabilities to view the associated course material.
