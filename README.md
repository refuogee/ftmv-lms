Create courses and the facilitators and learners associated with these courses so they can interact with plugin functionality and course material based on their permissions and capabilities.

**Description**

Created for a client's specific needs but trying to generalise in the interests of possibly creating a useful plugin.

**FTMV LMS** will give users the ability to create top level courses and then instances of when those courses run - eg. History 101 (top level) and then it running from say 1 March - 30 June (An instance). 

From the creation of this top level course a user type of facilitator and student associated with the course are created. Admin still has to create a facilitator associated with a specific course. The facilitator has the capabilities and permissions to create instances of the top level course and create new students for an instance of the course.

Studends of the associated course are created with the capabilities to view the associated course material.

**Features:**

* Create Top Level Course
* Create facilitators for created courses
* Admin or Facilitator can create sub-courses
* Admin or Facilitator can create users for created sub-courses

**Installation**

Will update once completed.
